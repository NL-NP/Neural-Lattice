# 🧠 Neural Lattice

The **Neural Lattice** is an open, structured knowledge framework designed to unify the understanding of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology through rigorously interconnected "nodes" of knowledge.

> **Mission:**  
> To provide free, high-quality educational resources accessible to everyone, while preserving intellectual rigor and preventing commercialization abuse.
