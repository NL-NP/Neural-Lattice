- **note**: these aren't your regular courses, this is pretty much an entire list of all of emperical science and mathematics that I could think of, for Mathematics, a topic such as "Geometry" deals specifically with spaces, so it's not just Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry, but also deals with Topology, for Geometry is defined to be the study of space and structure in here.
