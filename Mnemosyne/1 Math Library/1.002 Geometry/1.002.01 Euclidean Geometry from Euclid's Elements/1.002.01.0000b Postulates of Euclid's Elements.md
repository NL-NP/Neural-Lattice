### Proposed Postulates(Axioms)
1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point. 
2. To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line
3. To describe a circle with any centre and distance.
4. That all right triangle are equal to one another.
5. That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angle on the same sides less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side of which are the angles less than the two right angles.

I would just like to add on to postulate 5, in which it implies all lines that meet(intersects) forms an point.
